# Wordlist Extender

Extend wordlist by appending digits and special characters to each word.

Check an already existing wordlist [here](https://github.com/ivan-sincek/wordlist-extender/blob/main/dict/wordlist.txt) and the extended wordlist [here](https://github.com/ivan-sincek/wordlist-extender/blob/main/dict/extended_wordlist_capitalize_d3_c1_min8.txt).

**Please be careful not to crash your PC by using a too large wordlist or extending too far.**

Feel free to tweak this tool to your liking.

Tested on Kali Linux v2023.1 (64-bit).

Made for educational purposes. I hope it will help!

## How to Run

Open your preferred console from [/src/](https://github.com/ivan-sincek/wordlist-extender/tree/main/src) and run the commands shown below.

Run the script:

```fundamental
python3 wordlist_extender.py
```

If a strong password policy is enforced, passwords usually start with one capitalized word followed by a few digits and one special character at the end (e.g. Password123!).

What I use most of the time:

```fundamental
python3 wordlist_extender.py -w wordlist.txt -t capitalize -d 3 -c 1 -min 8
```

## Runtime

```fundamental

â””â”€# python3 wordlist_extender.py -w wordlist.txt -t capitalize -d 3 -c 1 -min 8
